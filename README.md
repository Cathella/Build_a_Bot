# Build_a_Bot 🤖🏅

Last week was the 🔅 lowest time for me ever since I began my Microverse 🚶‍♀ journey. My motivation percentage was at 0% 👎. I could not accomplish anything during that time frame. I have talked to some friends and they comfirmed that they have experienced such times too. This is the reason I choose to take on the Telegram bot 🤖  project to create a bot that can keep everyone inspired by giving an inspiration quote on request and as well to keep a smile on your face by requesting a funny joke. Just imagine coding with a 😄 smile!

## How the bot works

- The bot requires user to enter commands presented in the menu to access information provided by the bot.
