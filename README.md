# Build_a_Bot

This is a Microverse - Ruby Capstone Project. I built a Telegram bot uses commands entered by the user to fetch information as required by the user.

## How the bot works
- The bot requires user to enter commands presented in the menu to access information provided by the bot.

## Testing the bot
- To run the test cases, type (rspec spec/bot_spec.rb) in your terminal.
