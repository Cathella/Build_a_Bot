# Build a Telegram Bot 🤖

Last week was the lowest time for me ever since I began my Microverse 🚶‍♀ journey. My motivation percentage was at 0% 👎. I could not accomplish anything during that time frame. I have talked to some friends and they comfirmed that they have experienced such times too. This is the reason I choose to take on the Telegram bot project to create a bot that can keep everyone inspired by giving an inspiration quote on request and as well to keep a smile on your face by requesting a funny joke. Just imagine coding with a 😄 smile!

## How the bot works
- Clone the project [here](https://github.com/Cathella/Build_a_Bot/tree/display_menu) if you need to add more features.
- Navigate to project folder in terminal and run bundle to install gems reqiured for the project
- Run "gem install dotenv" in the terminal to load values in the .env file
- Run "ruby bin/main.rb" in the terminal and leave it open because it will be working as our server.
- Open your desktop Telegram app and search for @BadcodedayBot
- The bot will require the user to enter commands presented in the menu to access information provided by the bot.
- Video describing how the bot works can be accessed [here](https://www.loom.com/share/9e8e6b16fb024a7aac37e486207b7dd2)

## Testing the bot
- To run the test cases, type (rspec spec/laugh_bot_spec.rb and inspire_bot_spec.rb) in your terminal.
