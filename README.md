# Build_a_Bot

Last week was the lowest time for me ever since I began my Microverse journey. My motivation percentage was at 0%. I could not accomplish anything during that time frame. I have talked to some friends and they comfirmed that they have experienced such times too. This is the reason I choose to taken on the Telegram bot project to create a bot that can keep everyone inspired by giving an inspiration quote on request and as well to keep a smile on your face by requesting a funny joke. Just imagine coding with a smile!
