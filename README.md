# Build_a_Bot

## About the Project
This is a Microverse - Ruby Capstone Project. I built a Telegram bot uses commands entered by the user to fetch information as required by the user.

## How the bot works
The bot requires user to enter commands presented in the menu to access information provided by the bot.
